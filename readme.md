# real time chat made* in 50 min


## Purpose
This project was made as part of the weekly programming challenge hosted by [DevJam].
The project was made for learning purposes. Made by Jeb and mihett05.

### Why is this such a dissapointment

Olimme kunnianhimoisia ja yritimme tehd√§ liian laajan projektin. arvioimme v√§√§rin ajan, joka meill√§ menisi projektin tekoon. Lis√§ksi yritimme tehd√§ projektin minulle (jeb) vieraalla frameworkilla. I still wanted to participate and this is what I wrote in 50 minutes from what we had done in paint app. have mercy on me.
[Repository](https://github.com/mihett05/nice-chat) for original chat-app we tried to do, that we didn't finnish. 
### What I learned
Don't try to do too much, especially when eorking with such a little of time and new framework. Will do better next time. Thank you.

Client communicates with server using post request, sockets and api. 
Images are drawn using canvas and uploaded to external server using api. 
"Draw and Guess" -game uses' flask socketIO-sockets.

#### Frameworks and libraries:

- [Flask] - Micro web framework written in python.
- [Flask-Socketio](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Flask-SocketIO gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server.
- [Flask-login] - Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask.
#### Deployment
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.
